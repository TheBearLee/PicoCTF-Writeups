1. Calculate the decimal version of the hexadecimal number

There is simply only one step to this challenge since we are converting from hex to decimal so here we go-

0x3D

Since its hex, we read from right to left-

D = 13 (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F)

16^0 * 13 = 13

16^1 * 3 = 48

48 + 13 = 61

So, our decimal number is simply 61. Input this to the flag verifier!
