Similar to [[Lets Warm Up]] and [[Warmed Up]] this challenge is simply a conversion test.

1. Convert the decimal number to binary

This challenge is very straightforward and only takes one step.

In binary, it is base 2 which means big numbers will take many digits.

So to convert 42 to binary, lets first give ourselves several digits to make sure we can make it all the way up

2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0

Lets start with 000000

The least significant digit is the final one, which changes the number from even to odd. Since 42 is even, we don't need it.

Lets start with the most significant digit which is the largest digit, the first one (2^5)

So now we have 100000 which is equal to 32

We only need to add 10 in order to add up to 42 and we can do such with the 8 ( 2^3) digit and the 2 (2^1) digit to create-

101010
