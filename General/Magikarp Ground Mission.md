# Magikarp Ground Mission

This CTF mostly focuses on traversing directories and files.

# Use the ssh instruction given to you once you start the instance

We will cover how ssh works later, for now all you need to know is that it works similar to netcat.

# `cat` the file in the first directory and follow the instructions

Simply read the contents of the first part of the flag and follow the instructions to find the `/` directory.

# `cat` the contents of the second part of the flag

Follow the instructions to find the final part of the flag

# `cat` the contents of the final file

Submit the flag to the website!
