# What's A Net Cat?

This challenge focuses on the `nc` tool better known as "Netcat".

# Use the address and port number given in the instructions for the challenge

"Netcat" is a tool that creates a socket connection with a server on a given port to send and receive data. Netcat normally follows the following format-
```
nc [address] [port #]
```

Using this format we input the address and port number, and we receive data from the server that contains the flag to submit!
