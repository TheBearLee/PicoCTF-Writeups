# PicoCTF-Writeups

This is a collection of writeups for the PicoCTF challenges. They explain my thought process and how I solved each one. I really want to continue to practice CTFs as many experts claim to have gotten their cybersecurity jobs through doing them. I know CTFs can give experience in many different areas, although I do want to specialize in one, I hope to start on those sections soon.
